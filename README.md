# project_two_travel_tour

This react application fetches API travel data and presents it on the website.
There are several added functionalities such as deleting tours that are not interesting to us from the display. 
The show more and show less functionality has been introduced.
Also, after deleting all data from the display, a button appears which, when clicked, 
the application fetches data from the API again, and shows all travel data again.

Also, some basic CSS styling was done.
